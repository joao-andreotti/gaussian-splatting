# TODO

- organize everything in the actual repo ....

- reimplement the SSIM loss on pytorch to keep compuations on GPU
    - needs a perf stratification analysis to verify that that is the bottleneck [YES]

- use the datasets from the paper  ->  maybe extracting images from video not a good idea...

- interactivly viewing

...

- revisit colmap to extract FOV -> better initialization of points

- differente learning rates for the parameters

- maybe keep turning a l'infiny? paper cited 7K or 30K training iterations, we are doing 100 ...
